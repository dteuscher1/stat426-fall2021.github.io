Learning data science is not always simple. Data science is composed by knowledge from different disciplines including math, statistics, and computer science. Because learning data science requires acquiring a great amount of knowledge, it would be useful to also learn a little bit about how we learn. If we learn how to more effectively acquire new knowledge, store it, and retrieve it when necessary, we will be able to keep up with advancing technologies and become more efficient data scientists. 

## Principles of Successful Learning 

In this article, I will talk about seven principles mentioned in the book **Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning**. I will then provide examples of how to apply each of these principles when learning data science.

The seven principles are: 

1. Retrieval practice

2. Spaced, varied practice

3. Desirable difficulties

4. Elaboration, generation, and reflection

5. The illusion of knowing 

6. Learning preferences vs. learning styles

7. Growth mindset 


## Principle 1: Retrieval practice 

There is a big difference between repeating a concept to yourself after you just read it and trying to actively retrieve it. For example, when studying for a test, we might read again and again that the Central Limit Theorem is the name of the theorem stating that the sampling distribution of a statistic is approximately normal whenever the sample is large and random. After reading it several times, we might think that we know what the Central Limit Theory is. However, we would be confusing familiarity with actual knowledge. It is not until we can actively retrieve its definition from memory (without looking at the text again) that we can say that we know what the Central Limit Theorem actually is. 

The good news is that retrieval not only allows us to know whether we have learned something or not. It also helps us learn. Like Aristotle said, 'the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.' Trying to actively retrieve knowledge solidifies that knowledge in our memories. Therefore, we can use retrieval practice to test our knowledge, but we can also use it to help us retain it. 

A possible application of this principle would be to think of possible test questions while we are reading the material by the professor or while listening to lectures. This principle is particularly useful in very conceptual classes, such as statistics. Then, you can try to answer those questions.

Retrieval practice will allow us to store knowledge in our long-term memory, and this is when the next principle can come in handy. 


## Principle 2: Spaced, varied practice

In order to make sure that we can use information stored in our long-term memory when we need it the most, we have to practice retrieving that information at different times and in different contexts. If we try to retrieve a memory right before we are about to forget it, we are strengthening that connection in our mind. Therefore, we are consolidating that memory and engaging our long-term memory. 

In addition, we should switch topics during our study sessions to further consolidate our knowledge. But there's another advantage to that, which is that we can relate what we are learning in different classes. For example, we might be taking linear algebra and linear regression. If we are studying the properties of matrices and how to perform different operations with them, and then switch to the topics to the importance of independence in linear regression, we can see how these topics are connected. We would be creating even more connections in our brains, consolidating memories and learning how to apply our knowledge in the appropriate context. 

## Principle 3: Desirable difficulties

While being a college student can be hard enough, we can benefit from adding - or simply embracing - certain difficulties into our learning. There are many easy ways to 'study,' but this doesn't mean that they are the most efficient practices. For example, like we talked about before, it is easier to read a passage several times and think that we have learned that content just because we are familiar with the text than quizzing ourselves on those concepts. 

It might be counter-intuitive to think of difficulties as desirable, but when we struggle with a problem and try to come up with solutions (even if we fail), our learning improves. Results will appear to come slower, but they will be better and will last longer. 

Classes such as Probability and Inference or programming classes are great opportunities to try this principle. For example, we can first look at the practice problems at the end of the chapter and try to solve them, then we can read the chapter and try to solve them again. This will give you an opportunity to struggle and try to produce your own solutions. You will then be more prepared to learn the correct way to solve them. 

## Principle 4: Elaboration, generation, and reflection

This principle might be the easiest to apply. If you form a study group, you can use that opportunity to explain difficult concepts to each other. Coming up with examples or analogies is what this principle is about. If you teach a difficult concept to someone else, you will be forced to elaborate and reflect on the subject. This will consolidate your own understanding and will clearly show you if you have any deficiencies in your knowledge. 

To summarize this principle, I like to say that to be a good student you should try to be a good teacher. 

## Principle 5: The illusion of knowing 

As statisticians, we know that our assumptions are not always met, so we need a way to test them. One assumption students commonly hold is that they understand a topic when they truly don't. This is why we need different objective ways to test our knowledge and make sure that this assumption is met. It's just like the common phrase: if you can't measure it, you can't improve it. One way to do this, which is related to previous principles, would be to test ourselves. Quizzes give us an objective measure of our knowledge since we can see how many questions we get right or wrong. In addition, we can make a note of the topic that each question is testing so that we can study that topic further. 

Use practice tests provided by your professors, practice questions in your textbook, and programming challenges found on the internet. 

## Principle 6: Learning preferences vs. learning styles

This principle is very interconnected with the previous principle. Most of the time, we enjoy doing the things we are naturally good at. It's human nature. However, what is easy is not always the same as what is best. Like we talked about before, you don't want to focus on only doing things you are naturally good at because 1) you will think that you know more than you do and 2) it is not necessarily what promotes learning. 

For example, if you are good at making diagrams but bad at taking quizzes, you have to make sure that you practice both. Or, if you are good at coding but don't really understand the underlying assumptions of the analysis you are performing, you shouldn't focus on what you prefer or are good at, but you should instead focus on what you are lacking or need to improve so that you promote your learning and not your ego. 


## Principle 7: Growth mindset 

Finally, you might feel that you are not smart enough to be a data scientist or that you are having too many difficulties. If this is the case, it is important to remember that intelligence is not set but is malleable. In addition, you will now have the right tools and learning strategies to exponentially improve your learning process. Learning is more a marathon than a sprint, and having a growth mindset will help you stay motivated to reach your goals. 

## Conclusion

![Growth Mindset Conclusion](https://edsurge.imgix.net/uploads/post/image/12467/mind_as_muscle-1565189295.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=1024&h=512&fit=crop)

The most important part of becoming a data scientist is having the right approach. It is not only about intelligence or hard work, it is also about putting in the right kind of work and being consistent. In addition, it is important to remember that there are many resources available to students to make their learning path easier to navigate. Learning is not something we do once and then forget about it, it is something we are doing all the time. Therefore, we might as well get good at it.
