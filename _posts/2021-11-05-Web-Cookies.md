## Introduction

Web cookies have become an interesting phenomenon that has caused a variety of responses to the use of data used by everyday people.  Most don’t understand what they are or what they do but fear them because of the potential of privacy invasion.  Others say they are necessary for any user to have the optimal experience on any legitimate website that they may choose to visit.  And some few have decided to try and exploit them for their own benefit at the expense of others.  But what are cookies, and how can they be useful if used the right way in the hands of a data scientist?

## What are cookies?

Put simply, web cookies are small text files created by a website server.  They are stored on a person’s computer as a history of their browsing experience on a website.  Information tracked could include a user ID created by the website for your computer, cart history, number of visits to a specific page, etc.  This data is used to enhance a user’s experience when they return next time.  Their cart will be up to date with all items and customizations still showing, and overall website experience will be enhanced since the information stored in cookies can be used to infer what the user will want to view next.
Most of the time, these cookies are created to be anonymous.  They don’t have any other intentions besides functionality that is solely intended on helping you navigate their website.  

While many types of cookies exist they can roughly be broken down into three categories:

1. First party cookies
2. Third party cookies
3. Zombie cookies

Each is collected and used in a different way.  First party cookies are created by the host website itself.  These will include website usage data and tracking, along with anything else that the site has been programmed to track.  

Third party cookies are created from ads or other embedded content on a given website.  These cookies are created by companies trying to catch your attention and serve to track your interactions with them, along with any navigations to the host website.

Zombie cookies are interesting bits of data that are don’t really do anything.  They get embedded deeply into the memory of your browser on your computer and are extremely difficult to get rid of.  While this type is not common, they are mostly used to ban users from a domain. By storing this cookie, the website can see that a user does not have permission to access the website and will block their connection.

## Extreme Cookie Hype

Why did all the concern pop up about web cookies?  Recently every website seemingly pushes you an angry pop up demanding that you accept their cookies.  Many domains began requiring the acceptance or at least notification of these pieces of data when web laws were created around data usage in Europe.  While not required everywhere, many domains began pushing them everywhere to cover themselves legally.  As such they gained a lot of attention very quickly.  Data protection and privacy are becoming more important as data is quickly becoming a commodity from which businesses can grow and become more successful at an accelerated pace.

While this data is important, the concern users have that these snippets of data can be malevolent is real and limiting for businesses.  Can they be harmful?  On their own, the answer is no.  They are simple text files and contain nothing close to executable.  Nothing can be installed or changed on your personal computer through a cookie.  They truly are just data chunks to enhance your experience while surfing the web.  The danger comes from getting a virus on your computer which allows a hacker to gain control of your computer.  At this point if their goal is to get after the data stored in your cookies, they would be able to do it.  This could amount to, at worst, having your logins and passwords taken.

This is an uncommon occurrence, however, and the likelihood of a hacker deciding to get into your cookies and explore if any of them are storing your personal information is low.  Once someone gains that much access to your computer, the odds are that they won’t be fishing around in your amazon shopping cart to figure out what Christmas presents you’re getting for your loved ones this year.

## Cookies in the Hands of Data Scientists

The true and awesome use of cookies comes when someone who knows how to use it is able to run analytics and history on the data created on the server.  Data scientist are able to use the information stored in these cookies for several purposes.  Anything from cursor clicks to searches can be used to predict what appeals to a user and can be used to improve the website interface and algorithms.  Over time these small pieces of information pile into machine learning algorithms that will, in turn, directly change the future experiences of others who may visit the website.

Data scientists are also directly able to track and predict what products will appeal to a customer, how to market and display products on a company’s website (and in what order they should appear), and even what products to advertise when viewing a specific item in more detail.  Amazon is a great example of how these algorithms work.  Often times you will find something that truly suits your needs by viewing the suggested products on the page of something that you are already looking at.

Surfing the web is fun and it’s incredibly convenient for a machine to try and predict what you will want to see.  It’s very convenient for us as users that many of these algorithms cut out the work of navigating to a specific page after hours of searching and clicking.  Using data is extremely important for the overall use of a website and the invention of browser cookies is an awesome for a server to track information without having to store it all on sight.  As long as you only visit sights that are reputable, the risk that they pose to you is almost 0, and the chance that analytics will somehow enhance your experience is high.
