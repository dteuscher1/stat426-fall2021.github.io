When I first learned about the version control system Git and its corresponding
web based repository GitHub, I struggled to understand the purpose behind them.
It was not clear to me why I should be using them or how they could be beneficial.
I assume that many of you had a similar experience when these tools were first introduced to you.
It is on this assumption that I have based the topic of this post. Over the past year
I have used Git and GitHub consistently in two scenarios that have not only helped me
learn how to use these tools effectively, but I believe will also shed some light on
the advantages and sometimes necessity of them.

## Example 1: Modular Development of Personal Projects
I named this post *Practical Examples of Using Git and GitHub* but I must admit this
first example is not so much practical as it is a way that has helped me practice using
Git and GitHub. That being said, it has been such a beneficial experience for me as I've
been learning how to use these tools that I strongly recommend it to any of you who want
to improve your skills or increase your familiarity with them. Since learning about Git
and GitHub, I have used both of these resources to **track my progress on many coding
projects in which I am the only contributor.**

So what does that actually mean? It means I've simply initialized the directories these programs
are stored in as git repositories and then staged and committed the changes I made to them at
frequent intervals, much like I would frequently save a Microsoft Word document to my disk
as I added to and edited an essay. Frequent staging and committing of files and pushing and
pulling of changes really helped me to become comfortable with working with Git from the
command line and syncing my local repositories with remote ones on GitHub. Not only that,
doing this created a log of commits that I could revert back to if I ever wanted to return
to a working version of my code in the event I introduced bugs or ineffecient algorithms
that I wanted to start over from.

A good example of this was when I was enrolled in CS 236 here at BYU. For those who don't know, the
majority of work done in 236 is on 5 projects that sequentially build off of one another to
eventually create one large working program. I used Git and GitHub to track my progress on this
program throughout the semester.

Specifically, I initialized the directory that this program was stored in as a git repository and
synced it with a remote repository on GitHub. Then, when I began each of the 5 projects throughout
the semester, I created a new branch to develop that part of the code on. As I made progress on a
given project, I frequently staged and committed changes to that working branch and pushed those
changes to the remote repository. Once my code for that project was officially passed off by a TA,
I would submit a pull request and merge that project's branch into main. The main branch would then
be up to date and ready to be branched off from at the start of the next project (see below the
repository and commit log).

Using Git and GitHub to track my progress on these projects really helped me become familiar with
common commands and development processes. The log of commits was also really advantageous to have.
Occassionally, I would make a change to the code, only to realize a day or two later that I
had made a mistake by doing so. Thanks to the log of commits, I could go back and see what code I had
before when the project was still working.

For anyone that is new to Git or GitHub, I strongly recommend developing your personal and class projects
using these tools. Not only will it improve your skills with them, but you'll build yourself a nice
portfolio of projects over time.

## Example 2: Collaboration with Co-workers
This second example is more illustrative of a practical or real-world case where these tools would be used.
In January 2021 I began working with two other students as a research assistant here at BYU to develop
an R package for performing rare-event meta-analysis. In order to efficiently accomplish this task in which
we often **collaborated asynchronously**, using Git and GitHub was essential.

An R package, as you might imagine, has a lot that goes into it ([R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)). In addition
to developing the source code, we also had to include necessary dependencies, create various forms of documentation,
and obtain licenses. Not only that, but the method that would ultimately be implemented by this package was
originally written in C, so there was a lot that needed to be done to allow this code to interact with the package.
Without a version control system, working on a project like this would require all of us to be present in a common
location with a single device to make and save changes on. However, using Git and GitHub allowed us to work
asynchronously on our own devices at a much more efficient pace.

Specifically, we created a repository on GitHub to store this project. We then all cloned this repository to
our local devices and, by frequently pushing and pulling changes, we ensured the repositories on our devices
matched the one on GitHub. We created branches for each of the various tasks we had to accomplish and communicated
clearly who was responsible for the various subtasks on each branch. For example, we had a branch for refactoring
the C code to C++. We had a branch for writing the R source code and another branch for writing generic functions
in R. We also had a branch for documentation purposes. On each of these branches we would frequently stage, commit,
and push changes we made so the others could pull those changes to their own devices. When everything we hoped to
accomplish on a given branch was complete, we would submit a pull request. After each member of our team had reviewed
the changes on this branch and approved them, the branch would be merged into main and then deleted (see below the
repository and commit log).

The process described above is typical of many software engineering and/or data science projects, and hopefully it
illustrates why these version control tools are so necessary.

## Conclusion
In a world that is increasingly embracing (or at least tolerating) remote and asynchronous work, the ability to use
version control systems like Git and GitHub is essential. By familiarizing yourself with these tools as you work on
your own projects, you will prepare yourself to be a valuable contributor to future projects with your co-workers.
