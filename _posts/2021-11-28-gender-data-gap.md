“One of the most important things to say about the gender data gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don't get said at all. Because when we say human, on the whole, we mean man.”
      ― Caroline Criado Perez


## Introduction

If you have ever felt confused when people talk about white male privilege but aren’t interested in op-ed pieces, or if you are curious about the role data plays in sexism but don’t know where to start, this is the book for you! Caroline Criado-Perez, author, provides detailed and well-researched examples in every sphere to demonstrate the gender data gap and why it matters.

## What is the Gender Data Gap?

The gender data gap is the fact that the majority of data we have in the world is based around the male body and the typical male life pattern. Data is fundamental to our world today.  We are dependent on data to make decisions in every aspect of life; health care, education, transportation, workplace and more.  But if the data isn’t representative of the population or if the data isn’t aggregated by gender, the results are biased.  

## What does it look like?

Criado Perez gives example after example ranging from slightly annoying (women freezing in their offices because temperatures are adjusted for the higher metabolic rate of men), to deadly (women being more 17% more likely to be killed in car collisions because male dummies are used for safety testing) making it clear to see just how ubiquitous gender data bias is.
Another example is with research on heart attacks.  Much of the research on heart attacks has focused on men. This has led to a life-threatening gender data gap because roughly two thirds of women experience less-typical symptoms.  A British cardiology study revealed that women experience 50% higher rates of heart attack misdiagnosis with fewer women surviving the first attack.
One of the most alarming examples from this book was about medical research. Women are routinely excluded from clinical trials even though sex differences are found in every single organ and tissue and in the prevalence, course and severity of most common diseases.  Diseases that only affect women (ex. Pre-menstrual syndrome) are consistently under-studied, whereas male specific diseases have significantly more funding and research.  Even when women are included in clinical trials, data is rarely sex-aggregated which makes determining different responses between male and female impossible to determine. A pain medication that doesn’t work for men, may work great for women but without aggregating the data, you’d never know.

## Why should we care?

Unrepresentative data leads to bad results and conclusions. Data feeds into algorithms and hardware that turn into products and solutions that systematically favor half the population. Hardware, such as phone sizes or shelf heights, are simpler to fix.  Algorithms are more difficult. As future data scientists and statisticians it is important to understand the flaws and consequences of the way things are done now so we can make more informed decisions when we have more influence. Part of data science education is understanding the implications that limited perspectives and biases of have on society.

## What can be done?

This book doesn’t try to explain why the gender data gap exists or who is to blame, it simply lays out data-backed examples to illustrate that the problem exists and that education on the issue and more diversity can alleviate the problem.  
Here is one example of how diversity can help with the gender data gap. Gyms, parks and sports grounds are typically male dominated.  Officials chalk this up to a difference in preferences between men and women. Recent studies show that when men and women’s preferences are accounted for in the design of these spaces, they are equally used between genders. Diversity is essential in groups of decision makers.  Many of the gender data bias is not due to explicit sexism, it is because the people in the room making the decisions are male, and either assume that female needs are the same as theirs, or they fail to remember women’s needs at all.  This applies to racial minorities and other marginalized groups.  The more perspectives are involved in planning, the less likely it is that bias will continue.

## Conclusion

I would highly recommend this book to everyone, men and women.  It has helped me see things through a new lense.  The book is full of Criado Perez's humor and wit but is all very data driven so it isn't just her opinions, she drives her point with facts.  In a world that is more and more data-driven, these types of conversations need to be had.  It is the way to make the world a more comfortable place for women and other groups that are routinely overlooked.  This book challenges the reader to take a step outside their own perspective and think about ways biased data presents itself in society.  Besides the examples given in this blogpost, where have you seen the gender data gap?
