description: Data ethics is a new branch of data science that deals with ethical guidelines. These data ethics cover all aspects of data science including data security, transparency, getting data, and others. Data ethics are an important topic for all data scientists.

We live in a fast moving, innovative world where the phrase “big data” can be a dinner conversation topic. Big data and data science have changed the way world runs. Companies actively search for and hire data scientists because of the impact they can have. While applying data science methods in research or in industry can result in knowledge and decisions otherwise unbeknownst, there needs to be a discussion of how and when data science can be used. Though “big data” has become a buzzword that has gotten people discussing its powerful effects, the ethics of data science is often missing in these discussions. Ethical concerns regarding data science needs to be in the forefront of the conversation and application of data science methods. Though data science and ethics are largely studied in different colleges within a university, they are lot more connected than people realize.
# Data Ethics
So, what exactly are data ethics? Luciano Floridi and Mariarosario Taddeo are Oxford professors who wrote an article titled [What is data ethics?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2016.0360) They define data ethics “as a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, artificial agents, machine learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values).” Floridi and Taddeo are aware that data science is still being defined leading them to define data ethics to cover many areas of data science.

As mentioned earlier data science can bring improvements to our lives whether we’re aware of it or not. It can also bring improvements to the environments we live in. However, these possible improvements come with ethical challenges that data scientists and researchers must be mindful of. Navigating these ethics is not impossible though finding the balance will be difficult. Not following ethical standards can lead to negative impacts while overstressing them in unnecessary situations can lead to a lack of results and failing to reap the rewards of data science (Floridi & Taddeo, 2016).
# What Can We Do as Data Scientists?
Anyone who is a part of the data science community can help bring awareness to data science ethics. We as data scientists must be knowledgeable of data ethics and must think of all the possible impacts our research or projects can have. Because data ethics can be nuanced unclear at times, we must dedicate time to learn these ethics. It may not be easy to see an unethical step in a data science project immediately, but fortunately, there are tips from professionals. DJ Patil, Hilary Mason, and Mike Loukides, who are all data scientists and very involved with ethics, created a data ethics checklist that data scientists can easily follow. Listed below is their checklist.
1. Have we listed how this technology can be attacked or abused? [SECURITY]
2. Have we tested our training data to ensure it is fair and representative? [FAIRNESS]
3. Have we studied and understood possible sources of bias in our data? [FAIRNESS]
4. Does our team reflect diversity of opinions, backgrounds, and kinds of thought? [FAIRNESS]
5. What kind of user consent do we need to collect to use the data? [PRIVACY/TRANSPARENCY]
6. Do we have a mechanism for gathering consent from users? [TRANSPARENCY]
7. Have we explained clearly what users are consenting to? [TRANSPARENCY]
8. Do we have a mechanism for redress if people are harmed by the results? [TRANSPARENCY]
9. Can we shut down this software in production if it is behaving badly?
10. Have we tested for fairness with respect to different user groups? [FAIRNESS]
11. Have we tested for disparate error rates among different user groups? [FAIRNESS]
12. Do we test and monitor for model drift to ensure our software remains fair over time? [FAIRNESS]
13. Do we have a plan to protect and secure user data? [SECURITY]

As we plan projects, we need to think about the data science checklist just as we think about different models to run or plots to create. The checklist is not exhaustive but it’s certainly a starting point where we can discuss these questions ourselves or with our team. Because of the ambiguous definition of data science some items on the checklist may not pertain to your duties on a project but helping other teammates know these questions will help the project as a whole.    

# What Can Places of Learning and Industry Do?
Individual efforts to prioritize data ethics will be extremely beneficial but implementing a systematic approach to data ethics will be even better. Colleges and universities should provide a class focused on data ethics for students or at least discuss data ethics as a unit in classes. Online learning courses such as w3schools, LinkedIn Learning, edX, also should provide modules that teach data ethics.

Industry should provide training on ethics for those that might not have had a data science background. Data ethics will always branch out and develop as long as data science continues to advance. Therefore, companies should keep their employees up to date on ethical issues as they arise. Trainings for employees can consequently improve business while keeping their company within the ethically drawn lines.
# Conclusion
Data scientists are simliar to lawmakers as we are responsible for how data science impacts citizens. Lawmakers should focus on ethics when determining laws and in the same fashion data scientists should focus on data ethics.

Data science will help our society, but we need to make sure it doesn’t do so unethically. Those involved in data science in any capacity can help confirm data science uses ethical methods to improve our lives by using the data science checklist and encouraging others to do the same. While data ethics is a new discipline of data science, it needs to be a priority just like the Hippocratic oath is to the medical community.
