## Intro:

You are sitting in the chair at your desk, about to train a model so that you can use it to make predictions on your current data. However as soon as you run the code, you discover that it isn't going to take as fast as you thought it was going to take. Instead of waiting 15 seconds, you will have to wait 5 minutes. The best thing to do to avoid this situation in the future is to upgrade your computer. However, not everyone has the time or the money to do so. Therefore the second best thing is to use this time while your machine is learning to learn how to become a better data scientist. As such, here are the Top 10 Skills a data scientist should know.


## Skill 1: Being Curious

![Skill 1](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill1.jpg)

The most important skill in being an effective data scientist isn’t actually about the field data science itself. It's about the tendency to ask questions relentlessly. A successful data scientist isn't someone who looks at data and doesn't know what to say. Instead they are very curious to understand what the data is actually saying and also if it can answer questions that haven't been asked in the first place. Therefore the most important skill in becoming a successful data scientist is being curious and always wondering about why it works the way that it works.



## Skill 2: Understanding Statistics

![Skill 2](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill2.png)

However, just being able to ask intellectual questions isn't very helpful if you don't understand how to find the answers. Therefore just like coding, another skill a data scientist should have is an understanding of probability and statistics and also the best way to apply what you have learned. Often times a simple understanding of statistics is not enough and effective data scientists have to have a solid understanding of statistics so that they are able to come up with a better model or algorithm that can describe the data more clearly


## Skill 3: Communicating with your machine

![Skill 3](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill3.jpg)

You can be one of the smartest mathematicians or understand the theory of probability really well, however if you don't understand how to communicate with your machine and tell it what you want it to do, you aren't going to get far in the data science world. This is because although you can come up with an impressive algorithm, if you aren't able to write it in a language that a machine can understand you are then obviously unable to use thar algorithm. This is where knowledge of common data science languages such as Python, SQL or R is a necessity. Because machines aren't able to make decisions on their own, we have to tell them what they need to do.

## Skill 4: Manipulating data.

![Skill 4](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill4.png)

Another skill a data scientist should have is knowing how to prepare their data so that they are more easily able to draw conclusions from it. Majority of the data that data scientists receive isn't very nice or  beautiful to look at. A lot of times the data is very unorganized and therefore in this current situation it is nearly impossible to draw conclusions and to discover and answer questions. Therefore an effective data scientist knows how to take any dataset and make it so that it is way easier to work with. Although this does not seem like that much of an important skill in data science, it is one of the most important skills because without it, the job of data scientist becomes much harder, nearly impossible. 

## Skill 5 Exploring the Data 

![Skill 5](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill5.png)

This is also one of the most important skills that a data scientist should know. However it is also one of the hardest and most time consuming but also very rewarding in the end. This is because it takes a lot of patience and intelligence to draw conclusions from the data. An effective data scientist is someone who, when given tons of data, is then able to come to the company with an answer to questions that the company doesn't even have. Therefore this skill goes hand in hand with the being curious skill because if you aren't curious you will be unable to find concessions between the variables in the data.

## Skill 6: Machine Learning

![Skill 6](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill6.jpeg)

For some reason there are many data scientists that don't know much about machine learning. This is partly because it is somewhat of a new field and therefore not many people see the necessity of it. However machine learning techniques can put you ahead of the competition and make you very marketable. Therefore you should know techniques such as
factorization machines, clustering, decision trees, deep learning, optimization, neural  networks and their frameworks such as spark and tensorflow. 

## Skill 7: Using big data 

![Skill 7](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill7.jpg)

Speaking of which, this leads us to another skill that data scientists should know which is the use of big data. This is because in the past decade the creation, capturing, copying, and consumption of data went up by a whopping 5000%. As such the data sets that are used today aren't as simple as the datasets back then. Instead of a few tables with a few variables in each there are multiple tables with each table having multiple variables that somehow relate to each other. Therefore to develop insights from these types of data, data scientists should have a solid understanding of the most popular big data sets that are used.

## Skill 8: Knowledge of Business.

![Skill 8](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill8.jpg)

The understanding of how business works is very essential in becoming a good data scientist. Because a data scientist who understands business then is able to understand the benefit that his/her finding has for the overall organization zigon of a whole. It is now not much about completing a task that was assigned but understanding the importance of the task and the role it has to the entire company.

## Skill 9: Data Visualization

![Skill 9](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill9.jpg)

Another important skill in becoming a data scientist is knowing how to present your data in a way that can help you describe to others your findings. This is when you have to figure out what way your data should be presented. Therefore you should have a solid understanding of different kinds of charts such as histograms, bar graphs, pie charts and also advanced charts such as waterfall charts. Also being able to plot functions on these charts is very useful. Not only does doing so make the next skill a lot easier, it also makes exploring your data easier as well.

##Skill 10:  Communicating with others

![Skill 10](/assets/images/blogimages/figs-11-22/skill10.jpg)

Finally a very good skill that a data scientist should have is to be very effective in communication. Although you can find very valuable connections between variables if you aren't able to communicate it to others in an effective way then it would be hard for others to understand your discoveries. That is why a data scientist should also work on his/her communication skills because it isn’t the machine that does the communication for them, it is them.

## Conclusion

Now you see why the Data Science Career is a very rewarding but also very difficult career to have. This is because the best data scientists are people who are very good at math, statistics, developing models but also very good at implementing models and drawing conclusions based on what they were given. However if you are able to learn the majority of the above skills you will be way ahead of the competition. Therefore although you're not prolly going to be paid to develop these skills they will still make you a better data scientist overall.
