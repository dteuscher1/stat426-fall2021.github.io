## “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” – Hadley Wickham

### The Set Up

Have you ever walked into a messy room and been told to get to work? Where do you start? How do you complete the task quickly and effectively? The task is more often than not undesirable and overwhelming. Working with messy data is a bit like working with a messy room. The end goal is to find the desired result as quickly and effectively as possible (and with the smallest headache possible).

Data is collected constantly. Every click of the mouse, every purchase at the store – it’s all data that can be used and analyzed. So why is the data format so important? As a general answer, messy is hard to work with. It’s kind of like working with a messy room – it’s hard to know where to start and even harder to accomplish the task at hand. But that’s overly generalizing it. Let’s get to the details of why it’s so important.

### The Why

The reality is that the majority of the data sets we will encounter will be untidy. Untidy data happens because not everyone is familiar with tidy data and doesn’t apply its principles, or because data is often organized to benefit something other than analysis such as data entry. Tidying data is a small yet effective set of tools that apply to a wide range of un-tidy datasets. These few principles will greatly benefit the overall goal of collecting data – being able to interpret it and utilize it for the future.

When data is tidy, less time is spent manipulating the data, freeing up more time to spend on the heart of the issue – analyzing the data. The two main advantages of tidy data are first, it is a consistent way of storing data. It creates a uniformity to your data that makes manipulation and other processes much easier during analysis, modeling and creating graphics. This can also make it easier to automate processes and analysis for recurring multiple datasets. It will also help others be more able to help when necessary or take over an analysis if the data is in an easy-to-use format. Second, especially when using R, using variables in columns utilizes R’s vector capabilities to maximize functionality when analyzing the data. There are mutating and summarizing functions that are easily used when the data is tidy, but that you are unable to use when the data is in the proper format.

### The What

Tidy data has three rules:
1.	Each variable has its own column.
2.	Each observation has its own row.
3.	Each value has its own cell.

### Examples

That’s it. Those three simple steps are the entirety of tidy data. We could stop there, now that we know what it is, but maybe we should learn how to create it. The first step is to figure out what the variables and observations are in the data. In the example below, the variables are the country, year, and rate (respectively), and the observations are the individual responses to each variable. Sometimes, as in the example below, you will be able to make this distinction, but other times you will need to consult with those who entered in or generated the data. The second step is to resolve 2 problems that may occur:

1.	One variable might be spread across multiple columns.
2.	One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

In the above example, year was broken up into century and year. Now, these are two columns that may not ordinarily need to be broken up, they can usually be in the same column, but the principle applies to all datasets – if there is more than one variable in a column, they need to be separated. In the below example, we can see that data for the same country and year is spread across multiple rows. As you can see, the solution here was to create a new column for one of the variables, thus reducing the number of rows in the dataset.

Other problems with the data may include lack of column names, incorrect data types, or other mishaps. Once these problems are recognized and cleaned up, the data is now tidy and ready to use!

### Resources

It can be hard to learn this skill, but it is one that will benefit you gratefully. Thankfully, as more data becomes available, there is a greater push to create tidy data and hold on to some sort of uniformity. In learning how to create tidy data, this is great news as it means there are many resources available to help in data cleaning. A great resource in R is the tidyverse library, which was created for the intent of cleaning up datasets. Hadley Wickham is the creator of the Tidyverse library and has written has written [articles](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) and a book ([available free online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)) that go over the basic functionality as well as more in-depth examples for using tidyverse to tidy data. There are also [cheat sheets](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/11/tidyverse-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/), [example problems, and step by step instructions for tidying data](https://garrettgman.github.io/tidying/), leaving no more excuses for messy data (just as moms never take excuses for messy rooms). 

What have you found that has been most effective in creating tidy data or helping you learn to create tidy data?
